# GitHub repository for AVSS Paper ID 77: Reimagining Violent Action Detection with Human-Object Interaction

![](images/Proposals.jpg)

Abstract: The rising urban crime rates globally underscore the need for advanced video surveillance systems capable of autonomously detecting violent actions. Current deep learning models face limitations, struggling with subtle motions and lacking real-time capabilities. In response, we advocate for a paradigm shift in surveillanceoriented violent action detection, emphasizing the pivotal role of human-object interaction (HOI) detection as opposed to conventional action recognition methodologies. Our contributions include unveiling Violence-HOI (V-HOI), a dataset capturing HOI interactions in static surveillance images. Additionally, we introduce Violence-Net (VNet), a novel convolutional-transformer network architecture, which outperforms existing HOI approaches by 5.25 percentage points in mean average precision. Moreover, when trained on V-HOI, V-Net achieves near real-time processing at 10.43 frames per second, demonstrating its practicality in dynamic surveillance scenarios.
